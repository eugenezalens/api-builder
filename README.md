# API Builder - SOLID Principles Example

## Introduction

Welcome to the API Builder project, a practical implementation of the SOLID principles in software design. This project demonstrates how to build a flexible and maintainable query builder for APIs, adhering to the SOLID design principles.

## SOLID Principles Overview

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software. These principles are:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP) - A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP) - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
